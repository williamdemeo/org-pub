## Configure git on nix

### set the path to the git config file

To be more consistent with other nix configs, I want to make sure it's ~/.config/git/config and not `~/.gitconfig`.

Don't just make a symlink ~/.gitconfig --> ~/.config/git/config because, according to the man page:

If both files `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config` and `~/.gitconfig` exist, then they will be read (in that order).

If the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable is not set or empty, then `$HOME/.config/` is used as `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

So, just leaving ~/.gitconfig empty, or non-existing, and using ~/.config/git/config should work fine.

We do `mkdir ~/.config/git` and then issue the following commands:

```
git config --global core.editor emacs
```

Check that this causes the following to be placed in the file hat will be 
`~/.config/git/config`:


```
[core]
	editor = emacs
```

If the file `~/.config/git/config` does not exist, then the editor setting may have been put in
the `~/.gitconfig`, in which case, you should

```
mv ~/.gitconfig ~/.config/git/config
```

Next do:

```
git config --global user.name "William DeMeo"
git config --global user.email williamdemeo@gmail.com
```

Now the file `~/.config/git/config` should contain


[includeIf "gitdir:IO/"]
  path = .gitconfig-io

[includeIf "gitdir:hub/"]
  path = .gitconfig-hub

[user]
        email = williamdemeo@gmail.com
        name = William DeMeo


### New git setup

My new setup sets my email address to iohk.io when I'm working on repos in the
`~/git/hub/IO` directory and sets it to my gmail address otherwise.

Reference: see [this nice gist](https://gist.github.com/Icaruk/f024a18093dc28ec1588cfb90efc32f7) on the topic.



```
ln -s ~/.config/git/config ~/.gitconfig
```

## Make `ag` permanent in emacs

...so I don't have to keep reinstalling it! >_<

# Notes

## Nix notes

All configuration changes are performed by editing `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` and executing
`nixos-rebuild switch`.

NixOS provides the modules system for editing all configurations. Users should use the
option search tool to check if the option they need exists before attempting to manually
add files or configuration via low-level NixOS features like activation scripts.


I tried to search for a nix package to install the git mergetool `meld`, however, when I tried

```
nix search nixpkgs meld
```
I got an error

```
error: experimental Nix feature 'nix-command' is disabled; use '--extra-experimental-features nix-command' to override
```

so I tried

```
nix search nixpkgs meld --extra-experimental-features nix-command
```

but got another error:

```
error: experimental Nix feature 'flakes' is disabled; use '--extra-experimental-features flakes' to override
```

so I tried

```
nix  --extra-experimental-features nix-command  --extra-experimental-features flakes search nixpkgs meld
```

which finally worked and produced the following output:

```
- legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.gnomeExtensions.compare-filedir-from-clip (15)
  Copy/Select two Dirs/Files from anywhere such as `nautilus` or `gnome-terminal`, and then compare them (use `meld`) or open with Ctrl-O or open with context-menu.

- legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.meld (3.22.0)
  Visual diff and merge tool

- legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.python311Packages.meld3 (2.0.1)
  An HTML/XML templating engine used by supervisor

```


I installed `meld` with `nix-env -i meld`.


So we don't have to include those annoying "experimental" options in the future, we put the following inside
the `{ pkgs, ... }: { ... }` block of the `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` file:

```
  nix.settings.experimental-features = [ "nix-command" "flakes" ];
```

and then run `nixos-rebuild switch`.

** Install slack on nix

Put the following in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` and then run `nixos-rebuild switch`.

```
 environment.systemPackages = [
    pkgs.slack
  ];
```

## Fix home.nix configuration


I forgot to follow some of the directions mentioned [here](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html#sec-install-nixos-module). I did the following to resolve this:

```
sudo nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/release-22.11.tar.gz home-manager
sudo nix-channel --update
```

I added `imports = [ ./home-manager.nix ];`
to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`, which introduces a new NixOS option called `home-manager.users` whose type
is an attribute set that maps user names to Home Manager configurations.

My `home-manager.nix` file contains the following:

```
{ config, pkgs, ... }:
let
  home-manager = builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz";
in
{
  imports = [ (import "${home-manager}/nixos") ];

  home-manager.users.williamdemeo = {
  /* Here goes your home-manager config, eg home.packages = [ pkgs.foo ]; */
  };
}
```

But I think I'll change the imports line in `etc/nixos/configuration.nix` to the more standard `imports = [ <home-manager/nixos> ];`
since I'm not using any custom config options in `home-manager.nix`.


For example, a NixOS configuration may include the lines

users.users.eve.isNormalUser = true;
home-manager.users.eve = { pkgs, ... }: {
  home.packages = [ pkgs.atool pkgs.httpie ];
  programs.bash.enable = true;
};
and after a sudo nixos-rebuild switch the user eveâ€™s environment should include a basic Bash configuration and the packages atool and httpie.


If nixos-rebuild switch does not result in the environment you expect, you can take a look at the output of the Home Manager activation script output using

systemctl status "home-manager-$USER.service"
If you do not plan on having Home Manager manage your shell configuration then you must add either

. "$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh"
or

. "/etc/profiles/per-user/$USER/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh"
to your shell configuration, depending on whether home-manager.useUserPackages is enabled. This file can be sourced directly by POSIX.2-like shells such as Bash or Z shell. Fish users can use utilities such as foreign-env or babelfish.


By default packages will be installed to $HOME/.nix-profile but they can be installed to /etc/profiles if

home-manager.useUserPackages = true;
is added to the system configuration. This is necessary if, for example, you wish to use nixos-rebuild build-vm. This option may become the default value in the future.


By default, Home Manager uses a private pkgs instance that is configured via the home-manager.users.<name>.nixpkgs options. To instead use the global pkgs that is configured via the system level nixpkgs options, set

home-manager.useGlobalPkgs = true;
This saves an extra Nixpkgs evaluation, adds consistency, and removes the dependency on NIX_PATH, which is otherwise used for importing Nixpkgs.

Once installed you can see Chapter 2, Using Home Manager for a more detailed description of Home Manager and how to use it.
