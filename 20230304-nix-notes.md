# Notes on Nix and Nixos

## Nix

### Installing Nix

**Refs**.

+  [install-nix tutorial](https://nix.dev/tutorials/install-nix).

```
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh -s -- --daemon
```

### Fundamentals

**Refs**.

+  [nix.conf man page][]


Nix reads settings from two configuration files:

+  The system-wide configuration file `sysconfdir/nix/nix.conf` (e.g., `/etc/nix/nix.conf`
   or `$NIX_CONF_DIR/nix.conf` if `NIX_CONF_DIR` is set).

+  The user configuration file `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nix/nix.conf` or `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`
   if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set.

   The configuration files consist of `name = value` pairs, one per line. Other files can be
   included with a line like `include path`, where `path` is interpreted relative to the current
   conf file and a missing file is an error unless `!include` is used instead. Comments start
   with a `#` character. Here is an example configuration file:

   ```
   keep-outputs = true       # Nice for developers
   keep-derivations = true   # Idem
   ```

   You can override settings on the command line using the `--option` flag, e.g.,
   `--option keep-outputs false`.




### Packages and programs related to Nix

#### direnv

[direnv][] is an extension of the shell with a new feature that can load/unload env variables depending on the current directory.

Install [direnv][] with `sudo apt install direnv`.

**Use cases**.

+  Load environment variables of [12factor] apps.
+  Create per-project isolated development environments.
+  Load secrets for deployment.

**How it works**. Before each prompt, [direnv][] checks for existence of a `.envrc` (or `.env`) file in the current and parent directories and, if it exists (and is authorized), loads it into a bash sub-shell; all exported variables are then captured by [direnv][] and available in the current shell. This allows project-specific env vars without cluttering `~/.profile`.

Because [direnv][] is compiled into a single static executable, it's fast enough to be unnoticeable. It's also language-agnostic and can be used to build solutions similar to `rbenv`, `pyenv` and `phpenv`.


#### nix-env

[nix-env][] is used to manipulate Nix user environments, which are sets of software packages available to a user at some point in time. In other words, Nix user environments are a synthesised view of the programs available in the Nix store. There may be many user environments: different users can have different environments, and individual users can switch between different environments.

[nix-env][] takes exactly one operation flag which indicates the subcommand to be performed. These flags are documented [here][nix-env].


#### cachix

[cachix][] is a service for hosting *Nix binary caches*. A Nix binary cache is a binary result that Nix can use instead of performing the build.

Install the [cachix][] client using [nix-env][] as follows:

```
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
```

and then

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nix
sudo touch -a /etc/nix/nix.conf
echo "trusted-users = root williamdemeo" | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf && sudo pkill nix-daemon
```

**Example**.

Built the [1lab website repo][] using [cachix][] and [Nix][] as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:formalverification/1lab.git
cd 1lab
cachix use 1lab
nix-build
```

(This takes quite a long time (â‰ˆ20 min).)

## Nixos

### Installing Nixos

See [nixos-iso][].

### Installing other software

+  Starship: `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.starship`
+  MegaSync: `nix-env -i megasync`
+  home-manager: Put the following in the file `/etc/nixos/home-manager.nix`

   ```
   { config, pkgs, ... }:
   let
     home-manager = builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz";
   in
   {
     imports = [
       (import "${home-manager}/nixos")
     ];

     home-manager.users.my_username = {
       /* Here goes your home-manager config, eg home.packages = [ pkgs.foo ]; */
     };
   }
   ```

and then put `imports = [ ./home-manager.nix ]` in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`.

Whenever you change you home-manager configuration, you must rerun `nixos-rebuild switch`.

With this method, changing the configuration of an unprivileged user requires to run a command as root.


--------------

### Changing Mount Points

If you mount an external usb by clicking on its icon in the file manager,
then the mount point will be given a funky long name; in my case,

```
/run/media/williamdemeo/4741-2188
```

This makes it painful to use the cli to work with directories on the usb drive.

We would prefer if the mount point was simply called `usb`.

On ubuntu, we would have simply put the following line in `/etc/fstab`.

```
/dev/sdc1 /mnt/sdc1 auto defaults,user,rw,utf8,noauto,umask=000 0 2
```

In Nixos, the `/etc/fstab` file has a comment warning us that we should be modifying
that file directly. Instead, we should configure such system settings in

```
/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
```

file.  So, put the following lines in the `configuration.nix` file:

```
fileSystems."/usb" = {
    device = "/dev/sdb1";
    fsType = "auto";
    options = [ "defaults" "user" "rw" "utf8" "noauto" "umask=000" ];
  };
```

Then, run `nixos-generate-config` and `nixos-rebuild switch`.

## Other Miscellaneous Notes

### Comparing the contents of two directories

**Refs**.

+ [How To Compare Two Directories on Linux](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/compare-two-directories)

`diff --brief --recursive Dir1 Dir2`

**Examples**.

```
diff --brief --recursive Dir1 Dir2
Files Dir1/client.log and Dir2/client.log differ
Files Dir1/file02 and Dir2/file02 differ
Files Dir1/file03 and Dir2/file03 differ
Only in Dir2: file04
Files Dir1/subdir1/file12 and Dir2/subdir1/file12 differ
Files Dir1/subdir2/file22 and Dir2/subdir2/file22 differ
Only in Dir2/subdir2: file23
Only in Dir1: subdir3
```
