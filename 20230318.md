### Routine maintenance on alonzo.

**Ref**. [Things to do after installing nixos][]

+  Install `ag`

   Add `silver-searcher` to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

   `environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ wget zsh meld git emacs silver-searcher ];`

+  Change hostname from nixos to alonzo in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

   `networking.hostName = "alonzo";     # after F1 driver Fernando (not Church)`

+  Update packages:

   ```
   sudo nix-channel update
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade
   ```

+  Enable weekly garbage collection with the following in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

   ```
   # Enable automatic garbage collection (gc).
   nix.gc = {
                   automatic = true;
                   dates = "weekly";
                   options = "--delete-older-than 7d";
           };
   ```

   After `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`, check gc is running: `systemctl list-timers`.


+  Reduce "swappiness" with the following line in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

   ```
   boot.kernel.sysctl = { "vm.swappiness" = 10;};
   ```

   After `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`, check swappiness: `cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness`.

+  Make fingerprint reader work by adding the following to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

   ```
   # fingerprint reader: login and unlock with fingerprint (if you add one with `fprintd-enroll`)
   services.fprintd.enable = true;
   services.fprintd.tod.enable = true;
   services.fprintd.tod.driver = pkgs.libfprint-2-tod1-goodix;
   security.pam.services.login.fprintAuth = true;
   security.pam.services.xscreensaver.fprintAuth = true;
   # similarly for other PAM providers
   ```


+  Rebuild with `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`.

Upon next restart and login, since the terminal printed the message 

"Install rlwrap to use node: sudo apt-get install -y rlwrap"

I decided to install `rlwrap` (not using `apt-get` of course), so I looked for the nix package with

```
nix-env -qaP rlwrap
```

and, before the results were shown, the following warning 
and suggestion appeared:

"warning: name collision in input Nix expressions, skipping '/home/williamdemeo/.nix-defexpr/channels_root/nixpkgs'
suggestion: remove 'nixpkgs' from either the root channels or the user channels"

I checked that indeed I did have a `nixpkgs` channel in my user profile.

```
❯ ls .nix-defexpr/channels
```

So I invoked the following to remove it:

```
❯ nix-channel --remove nixpkgs
```

Next I added rlwrap to the following line of `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`.

```
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ wget zsh meld git emacs silver-searcher rlwrap];
```


### Install Doom Emacs

I decided to try [Doom Emacs][] as a possible replacement for spacemacs.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
```

Postinstallation message:

```
1. Don't forget to run 'doom sync', then restart Emacs, after modifying
   ~/.doom.d/init.el or ~/.doom.d/packages.el.

   This command ensures needed packages are installed, orphaned packages are
   removed, and your autoloads/cache files are up to date. When in doubt, run
   'doom sync'!

2. If something goes wrong, run `doom doctor`. It diagnoses common issues with
   your environment and setup, and may offer clues about what is wrong.

3. Use 'doom upgrade' to update Doom. Doing it any other way will require
   additional steps. Run 'doom help upgrade' to understand those extra steps.

4. Access Doom's documentation from within Emacs via 'SPC h d h' or 'C-h d h'
   (or 'M-x doom/help')
```



### Install/configure ghc on alonzo.



## spend some time learning Haskell
