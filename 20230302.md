# Details/Progress

## Finish review of andre/agda-2.6.3 PR

I approved the PR after finally getting it to type-check (on imac) and adding some comments pointing out a bunch of unused imports.

--------------

## Install cabal on lima (imac: intel xeon; macos: darwin)

Initial install of cabal on new imac.

Refs. 

* [Getting started with Haskell and Cabal][]
* [ghcup][]
* [agda-unused][]

Following the instructions at [ghcup][], I installed cabal and haskell using

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh`

The tail of the output gives the following info which may be useful later.

```
===============================================================================

OK! /Users/williamdemeo/.zshrc has been modified. Restart your terminal for the changes to take effect,
or type "source /Users/williamdemeo/.ghcup/env" to apply them in your current terminal session.

===============================================================================

All done!

To start a simple repl, run:
  ghci

To start a new haskell project in the current directory, run:
  cabal init --interactive

To install other GHC versions and tools, run:
  ghcup tui

## Install [agda-unused][] (requires cabal)

I installed [agda-unused][] using `cabal install agda-unused`.

This eneded up installing a ton of stuff (since this machine has a brand new cabal install).

In particular, it compiled and installed agda-2.6.2.2.  Be sure this version 
doesn't conflict with the latest version (2.6.3) that we're now using for the fls.

## Work on Issue #56

[Issue #56](https://github.com/input-output-hk/formal-ledger-specifications/issues/56)

The current MA implementation is still missing a few things, in particular:

- [ ] One or more implementations of the `Value` type (Fig. 3)
- [ ] Adjusting `scriptsNeeded` to include the `PolicyID`s of `mint` (Fig. 8)
- [ ] Preservation of value for token algebras (Lemma 8.1)
- [ ] Maybe more?

------------------------

## Notes

The `nix-build` commands given in the README.md of the `alasdair/multi-asset` branch work fine,
but when I load `/src/Everything.agda` into emacs and try to type-check, I get the following error:

```
.../formal-ledger-specifications/src/Ledger/Utxo.lagda:221,1-94

(The full error is about 8700 lines.)
