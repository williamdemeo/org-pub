# Details/Progress

## Notes from meeting with Andre

## Shelly spec

1.  The multiasset spec appendix has a proof of preservation of Ada.
    We need to translate this extension of preservation of Ada theorem to Agda.

2.  Shelly gaming the system is possible.
    The Shelly spec pdf is [here]()

## uninstall and reinstall nix

**Ref**. [this thread on discourse.nixos.org](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/anyone-up-for-picking-at-some-nix-onboarding-improvements/13152/8)


*Post of 3 Apr '22 by atayl16*.

I recently had to uninstall and reinstall Nix on my m1 mac. It took me quite some time, but this is everything I needed to get it removed and reinstalled.

Delete Nix Store from disk utility
Remove `/nix` entry from `/etc/fstab` (possibly optional) with `sudo emacs -nw /etc/fstab`

```
sudo rm -rf  /etc/synthetic.conf
sudo dscl . -list /Users | grep nix | xargs -I % sudo dscl . -delete /Users/%
sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/nixbld
sudo mv /etc/bashrc.backup-before-nix /etc/bashrc
sudo mv /etc/bash.bashrc.backup-before-nix /etc/bash.bashrc
sudo mv /etc/zshrc.backup-before-nix /etc/zshrc
```

**Reboot computer**

```
sudo rm -rf /etc/nix /nix /var/root/.nix-profile /var/root/.nix-defexpr /var/root/.nix-channels /Users/alishataylor/.nix-profile /Users/alishataylor/.nix-defexpr /Users/alishataylor/.nix-channels
sudo launchctl enable system/org.nixos.nix-daemon
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume
```

**Restart terminal**

These are some the threads I worked through as I hit each error:

1. [Unable to install Nix 2.4 and 2.5.1 on Mac OS Monterey · Issue #5498 · NixOS/nix · GitHub 5](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/5498)
2. [Installing nix on macOS BigSur · GitHub 1](https://gist.github.com/angerman/cbe02d814d81a8e4d4ced56b19046c19)
3. [Multi-user installation fails on macOS Mojave · Issue #4020 · NixOS/nix · GitHub](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/4020)
4. [I can't install Nix on macOS Catalina with multi-user · Issue #4106 · NixOS/nix · GitHub](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/4106)
5. [Multi-user Darwin installer fails to load org.nixos.nix-daemon · Issue #2780 · NixOS/nix · GitHub 7](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/2780)

To add some background, I had Nix multi-user on my machine, but a tutorial had me install the single user version as a requirement to continue. I then realized that I need the multi-user for work, so needed to add it back but hit a ton of issues, including some of the errors below:
```
error: the build users group 'nixbld' has no members
Could not find service "org.nixos.nix-daemon" in domain for system
org.nixos.nix-daemon.plist: Service is disabled
```

Hope this helps someone one day, maybe even future me!

EDIT - Check out the installation manual that toonn linked below, which solves every single issue here!

## fix nix-build problem for formal-ledger-specifications

After a complete reinstall of nix, of course the `nix-build -A agda` command takes a very long time...

----------------------

## Read section 8 of [mary-ledger.pdf][]

Need to understand proofs of preservation of value and Ada in multi-currency context so we can write a better, more general version of the preservation theorems.
