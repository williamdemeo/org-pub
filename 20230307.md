# Objectives

- [ ] Work on Issue #56
    - [ ] One or more implementations of the `Value` type (Fig. 3)
    - [ ] Adjusting `scriptsNeeded` to include the `PolicyID`s of `mint` (Fig. 8)
    - [ ] Implement proof of preservation of value for token algebras (Lemma 8.1)
- [ ] Install nixos on lima


# Progress/Details


## Work on Issue #56

[Issue #56](https://github.com/input-output-hk/formal-ledger-specifications/issues/56)

The current MA implementation is still missing a few things, in particular:

- One or more implementations of the `Value` type (Fig. 3)
- Adjusting `scriptsNeeded` to include the `PolicyID`s of `mint` (Fig. 8)
- Implement proof of preservation of value for token algebras (Lemma 8.1)

### One or more implementations of the `Value` type (Fig. 3)

### Adjusting `scriptsNeeded` to include the `PolicyID`s of `mint` (Fig. 8)

### Implement proof of preservation of value for token algebras (Lemma 8.1)
