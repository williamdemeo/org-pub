# Details/Progress

## Install/configure starship

I followed [these instructions](https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation),

Specifically,

```
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh\n
```

and then put `eval "$(starship init zsh)"` in `~/.zshrc`.

(Previously I tried loading starship using the oh-my-zsh convention and
created a new file `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/starship.zsh` containing the line
`eval "$(starship init zsh)"`, but for some reason this failed to load starship.)


## Uninstall and reinstall nix

### Uninstall nix
I followed the instructions at 
[iohk.zendesk.com](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415830650265-Uninstall-nix-on-MacOS)
and [this nix-tutorial](https://nix-tutorial.gitlabpages.inria.fr/nix-tutorial/installation.html#uninstalling-nix)

Specifically,

```
sudo mv /etc/zshrc.{,latest-}backup-before-nix
sudo mv /etc/bashrc{,-recent}
sudo mv /etc/bashrc.{,latest-}backup-before-nix
sudo rm -rf /nix
sudo rm -rf /etc/nix
sudo mkdir /etc/profile.d/old
sudo mv /etc/profile.d/nix* /etc/profile.d/old/
```

### reinstall nix

I followed the [official nix install instructions for laptops](https://nix-tutorial.gitlabpages.inria.fr/nix-tutorial/installation.html#on-your-laptop) 

Specifically,

```
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```

which produced the following output.

Switching to the Multi-user Installer
Welcome to the Multi-User Nix Installation

This installation tool will set up your computer with the Nix package
manager. This will happen in a few stages:

1. Make sure your computer doesn't already have Nix. If it does, I
   will show you instructions on how to clean up your old install.

2. Show you what I am going to install and where. Then I will ask
   if you are ready to continue.

3. Create the system users and groups that the Nix daemon uses to run
   builds.

4. Perform the basic installation of the Nix files daemon.

5. Configure your shell to import special Nix Profile files, so you
   can use Nix.

6. Start the Nix daemon.

Would you like to see a more detailed list of what I will do?
[y/n] y

I will:

 - make sure your computer doesn't already have Nix files
   (if it does, I will tell you how to clean them up.)
 - create local users (see the list above for the users I'll make)
 - create a local group (nixbld)
 - install Nix in to /nix
 - create a configuration file in /etc/nix
 - set up the "default profile" by creating some Nix-related files in
   /root
 - back up /etc/profile.d/nix.sh to /etc/profile.d/nix.sh.backup-before-nix
 - update /etc/profile.d/nix.sh to include some Nix configuration
 - back up /etc/zshrc to /etc/zshrc.backup-before-nix
 - update /etc/zshrc to include some Nix configuration
 - back up /etc/bash.bashrc to /etc/bash.bashrc.backup-before-nix
 - update /etc/bash.bashrc to include some Nix configuration
 - back up /etc/zsh/zshrc to /etc/zsh/zshrc.backup-before-nix
 - update /etc/zsh/zshrc to include some Nix configuration
 - load and start a service (at /etc/systemd/system/nix-daemon.service
   and /etc/systemd/system/nix-daemon.socket) for nix-daemon
```

Oops, forgot to get rid of `/etc/bash.bashrc.backup-before-nix` so I did

`sudo mv /etc/bash.bashrc.{,recent-}backup-before-nix`
