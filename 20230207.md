## Details and Progress Notes

### make install of `ag` permanent in spacemacs

As noted [here](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/7868), 
even if we install the `ag` package explicitly, on next startup spacemacs removes it as an "orphaned package".
Adding `ag` to the dotspacemacs-additional-packages in .spacemacs seems to have resolved this.

--------------

### reinstall nix on lampe

For some reason my nix command is not found even though I'm quite certain I had installed nix on my ubuntu machine.

So I reinstalled following the instructions [here](https://nix.dev/tutorials/install-nix).

In particular, I did

```
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh -s -- --daemon
```

(I discovered after the fact that the reason the nix command was not found in the shell is
because I had reset my path to exclude the nix path when trying to reconfigure my system
back to old settings before my talk, so my agda-algebras library would type-check (with a
cabal-installed version of Agda).)

--------------

### learn how to configure nix

I took a lot of notes about my experience getting started with nixos and the nix package manager.
These notes are collected in a separate file called 20230127-nix-notes.md.

Briefly,  I installed `direnv` with `sudo apt install direnv`.


### fix `nix-build` bug in formal ledger specification


### register domain names formalmethods.io and formalverification.io

[X] Registered formalmethods.io with namecheap.com before realizing that cloudflare also sells/registers domain names, which would have eliminated one step in the process.
[X] Register formalverification.io with cloudflare.

--------------

### configure/deploy notes/docs/blogs website formalverification.io

[X] Add cloudflare nameservers yahir.ns.cloudflare.com and tegan.ns.cloudflare.com to the namecheap dns config page for formalmethods.io
[X] Add formalmethods.io to cloudflare
[X] Create new formalverification/io github repo which will contain the static webpages to be served at formalverification.io
[ ] Create new formalverification/methods github repo which will contain the static webpages to be served at formalmethods.io
[ ] make a post about general configuration
[ ] make a post about nix-build bug


#### Cloudflare DNS configuration

[This page][github ip addresses] has the ip addresses that must be added to the cloudflare DNS configuration page---accessed from the [cloudflare dashboard][] to point the custom (apex) domain name (e.g., formalverification.io) to github pages.

https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain

The cloudflare domain name servers (DNS) are 

```
tegan.ns.cloudflare.com
yahir.ns.cloudflare.com
```

See also the [cloudflare docs][].

## Other Miscellaneous Notes

### Comparing contents of directories

Ref: [How To Compare Two Directories on Linux](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/compare-two-directories)

`diff --brief --recursive Dir1 Dir2`

Example:

```
diff --brief --recursive Dir1 Dir2
Files Dir1/client.log and Dir2/client.log differ
Files Dir1/file02 and Dir2/file02 differ
Files Dir1/file03 and Dir2/file03 differ
Only in Dir2: file04
Files Dir1/subdir1/file12 and Dir2/subdir1/file12 differ
Files Dir1/subdir2/file22 and Dir2/subdir2/file22 differ
Only in Dir2/subdir2: file23
Only in Dir1: subdir3
```

### Learn how to use github actions and cachix

+ [nix.dev/tutorials/continuous-integration-github-actions][]
+ [cachix][]

Installed Cachix client using Nix as follows:

```
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
```

and then

```
echo "trusted-users = root williamdemeo" | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf && sudo pkill nix-daemon
```

See https://github.com/cachix/cachix


**Example**.

I built the [1lab website repo][] using [cachix][] and [nix][] as follows:


```
cachix use 1lab
nix-build
```

(This takes quite a long time (â‰ˆ20 min).)
